# Project: Dine-In Digital - A Restaurant Ordering System
  

## Objective  
In this project, you will build an application that enables waiters to take customer orders for food and drinks and generate a bill upon order completion. Each bill will have a unique number, and once an order is finalized, the bill will be saved in a separate file named according to its bill number.

### Milestones  

| Milestone | Revision | Comments |
|-----------|:--------:|:--------:|
| [MS1](#milestone-1) | V1.0 | |
| [MS2](#milestone-2) | V1.0 | | 
| [MS3](#milestone-3) | V1.0 | | 
| [MS4](#milestone-4) | V1.0 | |
| [MS5](#milestone-5-the-final-milestone) | V1.0 | |

For this project, you will develop an application that enables waiters to take customer orders for food and drinks and generate a bill upon order completion.

Each bill will be numbered, and after an order is finalized, a copy of the bill will be saved in a separate file titled with the corresponding bill number.

> Only **Milestone 5** will be evaluated based on the **code quality**.

### Feedback   
Your professor may provide feedback on your first four milestones if time permits.  
If you require feedback on any of these milestones, you must request it by booking an appointment and having your code ready in your **OOP244 private GitHub repository**, which you shared with your professor in **Workshop 0**.



### **Submission Rejection Date: December 5th**  

**NOTE:**  
- Your **entire project will not receive a mark and will be considered incomplete** if **any of the first four milestones are not submitted** by the **rejection date**.  
- For your project to be marked, you must submit **all four milestones** and at least **one of the six Milestone 5 submissions** **before the rejection date**.


---

## **Checking Milestone Due Dates**  
You can check the due date of each milestone using the `-due` flag in the submission command:

```bash
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/prj/m? -due
```
- Replace `2??` with the **subject code**.  
- Replace `m?` with the **milestone number**.  

---

## **Citation and Sources**

All submissions will be compared against those of other students from this and past semesters.  
If you borrow any code and do not provide proper citation, it will be considered a **violation of Academic Integrity**, and you will be **formally charged**.

When submitting your work, all source files must include complete student information and citation details.  
Please use the following template and modify it to suit your submission:

```cpp
/* Citation and Sources...

```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Simply copying and pasting the above citation template without meaningfully modifying it to reflect your actual work and sources will be treated as **no citation** and may result in a **mark of zero** for that submission.

**Failure to include this citation** in *any* of your source files will result in a **mark of zero** for that submission.

If you **borrow any functions or code snippets** from another source, you must also include a **specific citation comment** above the relevant code, **in addition to** the general citation block at the top of the file.

If the borrowed code is **not from your professor**, marks may be **deducted** for that portion of the work.

> **Note:** This is not a group project. If two students submit similar code with a citation stating they collaborated, the project mark will be **shared between them** (e.g., each will receive a maximum of **50%**).



### **Example Citation for Borrowed Code:**

```cpp
// The following code is copied from Professor John Doe's class notes.
/// <summary>
/// Reads an unlimited number of characters from an input stream dynamically, resizing as needed.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="istr">Reference to the input stream to read from.</param>
/// <returns>Pointer to a dynamically allocated C-string containing the read characters.</returns>
char* Utils::read(istream& istr) const {
    ...
    return temp; 
}
```

> You **do not** need to cite any code provided as part of the official project template.


## **Compiling and Testing Your Program**  
All code must be compiled using the following command on **Matrix**:

```bash
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: Reports all warnings.  
- `-std=c++11`: Uses the C++11 standard.  
- `-g`: Includes debugging symbols for better `valgrind` reports.  
- `-o ws`: Names the compiled application `ws`.  

### **Checking for Memory Leaks**
To check for possible memory leaks, run:

```bash
valgrind --show-error-list=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ws
```
---

## Project Implementation Notes: **Very Important, Read Carefully**  

- All code written in this project should be within the `seneca` namespace.  
- You are free and encouraged to add any **attributes (member variables), functions, and methods (member functions)** you find necessary to complete your code. If you are unsure about your strategy for adding functionalities and properties to your classes, ask your professor for advice.  
- If you add methods that are **not called outside the scope of the class**, make sure they are **private**.  

- Unless you are given a specific definition, **name variables and functions yourself**. Use **meaningful** names and follow the **naming conventions** instructed by your professor. **Using misleading or unclear names will result in a penalty.**  

- When creating methods (member functions), ensure they are marked **`const`** if they **do not modify the class**.  

- When passing an object or variable by **address or reference**, if it is **not meant to be modified**, pass it as a **constant pointer or reference**.  

- If an **empty state** is required for an object, it is considered an **"invalid" empty state**, and objects in this state should be **rendered unusable**.  

- A module called **`Utils`** is included in the project. It contains a few predefined methods that you can use.  
  - You are allowed to **add your own custom functions and classes** to the `Utils` module for use throughout the project.  

- You may **reuse and copy** any **code provided by your professor**, functions from **workshops, previous projects, or other subjects** in the `Utils` module with no mark reduction, but you **must include a citation**.

# Project Modules Overview

The project is divided into six main modules and a main module that launches the application:

1. Utils
2. Menu
3. Billable
4. Food
5. Drink
6. Ordering
7. main


## Utils
This module should include utility functions used throughout the project to simplify development. For example:

- Functions for dynamic memory allocation for C-strings.
- Foolproof input handling functions (e.g., to ensure valid data entry).
- Other common helper functions to prevent code duplication.


## Menu
In this module, unlike the other modules you have created, there are two classes:

- `MenuItem` Class: Represents individual items on the menu.
- `Menu` Class: Manages a collection of `MenuItem` objects and allows the user to select items from the menu.

> You will implement member functions and operators that handle adding, removing, and displaying MenuItem objects and facilitate user interaction for selection.

 `MenuItem` and `Menu`. The `Menu` class owns a series of `MenuItem` objects and provides selection facilities for the user. 

## Billable
Abstract Base Class: This class serves as a foundation for all items that can be billed (e.g., food and drinks). 

It will define common interfaces (pure virtual functions) that derived classes must implement.

## Food

Derived Class: Inherits from Billable and represents a food item. This class should allow for different portion sizes, such as:

- Child portion
- Adult portion

## Drink

Derived Class: Inherits from Billable and represents a drink item. It should support various sizes:

- Small
- Medium
- Larg
- Extra Large

## Ordering

This module manages the ordering process and will include methods for:

- Loading available foods and drinks from data files.
- Displaying food and drink lists separately.
- Taking customer orders (interacting with the Menu class).
- Generating and printing the bill.
- Saving a copy of the bill to a file named after the bill number.

## Main. 

The main module should initialize and coordinate the program by:

- Creating an Ordering object.
- Handling user interactions (as the waiter) to navigate the ordering process.
- Calling methods from the Ordering class to execute actions based on user input.



# Milestone 1


> Note: As we move forward through the milestones of this project, remember that, like in any real-life project, we may need to revisit previous implementations to make changes or corrections to accommodate future requirements.

## `constants.h`
This header file is used to hold all the constant values used in the project. For now, add the following constant value:

- `MaximumNumberOfMenuItems` set to 20. (preferably unsigned)


## MenuItem class

Initially, we will implement this class as a standalone class. We will test it and make sure it works correctly. In Milestone 2, we will implement the Menu class, which is a composition of MenuItem objects.

When creating a menu formatted like the one below, the `title`, the `numbered rows`, and even `the prompt` for data entry at the end are considered MenuItem objects:

```text
Seneca Resturant                        <----  title
 1- Order                               <----  numbered row
 2- Print Bill
 3- Start a New Bill                    <----  numbered row
 4- List Foods
 5- List Drinks                         <----  numbered row
 0- End Program
>                                       <----  the prompt
```

In a module called Menu (i.e., Menu.h and Menu.cpp), create a class called MenuItem.

The MenuItem class must have a minimum of four attributes:

- A character pointer to hold the MenuItem content dynamically.
- An integer (preferably unsigned) to keep track of the number of indentations.
- An integer (preferably unsigned) to keep track of the size of each indentation in characters.
- An integer to be used for the numbering of MenuItem objects.


### Construction
The MenuItem should be constructed using the following four values:

- A C-string holding the content. This should be stored dynamically in the MenuItem content.
- The number of indentations.
- The size of each indentation.
- An integer for the row number (only used for numbered menu items).

#### Constructor Validations

If any of the following conditions occur, the MenuItem should be set to a safe empty state:

- The content is nullptr, empty, or consists only of whitespace characters.
- Any of the indentation or indentation size values exceed 4.
- The row value is greater than `MaximumNumberOfMenuItems`.

### Rule of three
The Rule of Three must be applied to MenuItem to ensure it is not copyable or assignable to another MenuItem, and that the memory is properly deallocated when a MenuItem is destroyed.

### bool Type Conversion Overload
If a MenuItem is cast to a bool, it should return false if it is in a safe empty state and true if it is a valid MenuItem.

### Display
The MenuItem class should have a display member function that outputs the formatted content of the MenuItem to an ostream. This function should be defined as follows:
```c++
ostream& display(ostream& ostr) const;
```
#### Function Requirements:
- The function should output the formatted content of the `MenuItem` to the given `ostream`.
- The function will have a default value of cout for the ostream parameter
- If the `MenuItem` is valid (m_content is not null), the function should:
   - Display the content with proper indentation based on the `indentation number` and the `indentation size`. 
   - Include the `row` number formatted as a two-character-wide value followed by `"- "` if row is non-negative.
   - Display the content without any leading whitespace. (skip the spaces in conent)
- If the MenuItem is in an invalid or safe empty state (e.g., m_content is null), the function should output `"??????????"`.
#### Output Expectations:
- Indentation should be added to align the content appropriately.
- The row number, if present, should be right-aligned and followed by `"- "`.
- If the content is invalid, display `"??????????"` instead.

```

## [Back to milestones](#milestones)

# Milestone 2

## Menu class

Add a class to the `Menu` module called `Menu`. The `Menu` class must own the `MenuItem` class as part of its composition. To enforce this, the `MenuItem` class should only be accessible by the `Menu` class.

To achieve this, remove the `public` keyword from the `MenuItem` class and make it fully private.

Forward declare the `Menu` class above the `MenuItem` class and add `Menu` as a friend of the `MenuItem` class.

With this change, only the `Menu` class can instantiate `MenuItem` objects.

### Attributes
- Add three integer (preferably unsigned) attributes to track:
  - The **indentation number and size** for `MenuItem` objects.
  - The **number of `MenuItem` objects** currently held in the `Menu`.

- Add three `MenuItem` attributes for the **title**, **exit option**, and **selection entry prompt** of the `Menu`. Since `MenuItem` does not have a default constructor, these attributes must be initialized in the **member initializer list**. Ensure that the initialization order matches the order in which the attributes are declared in the `Menu` class, as some compilers may issue warnings if the order is inconsistent.  
   > The row number of the `exit option` should be set to zero.

- Add an **array** of `MenuItem` pointers, sized according to the constant `MaximumNumberOfMenuItems`. When adding MenuItem objects, they should be dynamically allocated and stored in this array. Ensure that the number of `MenuItem` objects does not exceed the size of the array.

### Constructor
Create a `Menu` constructor with the following four arguments:

- A C-string for the **title**.
- A C-string for the **exit option content**, defaulted to `"Exit"`.
- An **indentation number**, defaulted to `0`.
- An **indentation size**, defaulted to `3`.

Initialize the corresponding attributes with these arguments and initialize the selection entry prompt `MenuItem` to `"> "`.

Set all elements of the pointer array to `nullptr`.

---

### `<<` Operator Overload for `Menu`

Implement the `<<` operator overload for the `Menu` class to dynamically add new `MenuItem` objects.

#### Requirements:
- The operator should take a `const char*` representing the `content` of a new `MenuItem`.
- Check if the current number of `MenuItem` objects is less than `MaximumNumberOfMenuItems` before adding a new item.
- If the condition is met:
   - Dynamically create a new `MenuItem` using the provided `menuItem` content, the current indentation level, the indentation size, and the row number (calculated as `number-of-menu-items + 1`).
   - Store the new `MenuItem` pointer in the `MenuItem` pointer array.
   - Increment `number-of-menu-items` to reflect the addition.
- Return `*this` to allow chaining of the operator.

#### Constraints:
- Ensure that `number-of-menu-items` does not exceed `MaximumNumberOfMenuItems`. If the array is full, the operation should not add a new item or increment `number-of-menu-items`.

This operator overload enables the use of the `<<` operator to add `MenuItem` objects to a `Menu`, enhancing readability and simplifying the process of building a menu.

---

### Rule of Three
Copying and assignment of a `Menu` object should be explicitly prevented. While this is inherently enforced by making `MenuItem` attributes private to the `Menu` class, explicitly deleting the copy constructor and copy assignment operator in comments enhances code maintainability and clarity.

Implement a destructor that iterates through the array of `MenuItem` pointers, deletes each non-null pointer, and sets them to `nullptr` to safely release allocated memory.

---

### `select` Method 
```c++
size_t select() const;
```
Implement the `select` method for the `Menu` class to perform the following actions:

#### Requirements:
- **Display the Title**: If the `Menu` object has a title, display it first.
- **Display `Menu` Items**: Iterate through all `MenuItem` objects stored in the `Menu` and display them one by one.
- **Display the Exit Option**: Display the `exit option MenuItem` after listing the main `MenuItem` objects.
- **Display the Selection Prompt**: Display the `selection prompt` `MenuItem` to indicate that user input is expected.
- **Return the User's Selection**: Obtain and return a validated integer input representing the user's choice. The input should only be valid if it falls within the range of `0` (representing the exit option) to the number of `MenuItem` objects currently in the `Menu`. See the `getInt` function suggestion below.

#### Expected Outcome:
- The method should output the full menu structure in a readable format and handle user selection.
- It should ensure that the selection is a valid integer within the specified range before returning it.

#### Sample Output:
Two example menus:  
The first has zero indentation, the second has one level of indentation.
```text
Seneca Restaurant
 1- Order
 2- Print Bill
 3- Start a New Bill
 4- List Foods
 5- List Drinks
 0- End Program
> 1
   Order Menu
    1- Food
    2- Drink
    0- Back to main menu
   >
```

---

### Insertion Operator Overload into `ostream`
Create an `operator<<` overload for the `Menu` class:
```c++
size_t operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const Menu& m);
```
#### Requirements:
- The operator should handle output to an `ostream`.
- When `ostr` is `cout` (check their address to confirm), the operator should invoke the `select()` method of the `Menu` class and return the user's selection.
- The return value should be the result of the `select()` method, representing the user's choice from the menu.
- If the `ostream` is not `cout`, do not perform the selection operation; simply return `0`.

#### Outcome:
- The operator should display the `Menu` on `cout` and allow the user to make a selection, returning the valid selection as a `size_t`.
- Ensure that the operator returns `0` when used with any `ostream` other than `cout`.

> **Note:** Unlike typical insertion overloads, this operator does **not** return an `ostream` reference.

---

## `Utils` Module Foolproof Entry Functions
> The following will be tested in **milestone 5**.

To ensure foolproof data entry, implement two functions in the `Utils` module and use them within your `select` method.

---

### `getInt`
```c++
int getInt();
```
Create a method in the `Utils` class to handle integer input with the following requirements:

#### Requirements:
- **Prompt for Valid Input**: Continuously prompt the user until a valid integer is entered.
- **Handle Empty Input**: If the user presses Enter without typing anything, display:
   ```text
   You must enter a value:
   ```
- **Validate Integer Input**: If the user enters non-integer data, display:
   ```text
   Invalid integer:
   ```
   Clear the error state before prompting again.
- **Check for Trailing Characters**: If extra characters follow the integer, display:
   ```text
   Only an integer please:
   ```
   Prompt the user again.
- **Clear Input Buffer**: After processing the input, clear any remaining characters to prepare for the next entry.

#### Outcome:
The method should only return a valid integer after ensuring proper validation.

---

### `getInt(min, max)`
```c++
int getInt(int min, int max);
```
#### Requirements:
- **Range Validation**: Prompt the user until a valid integer within the range `[min, max]` is entered.
- **Use `getInt()`**: Utilize the basic validation logic from `getInt()`.
- **Handle Out-of-Range Values**: If input is outside the range, display:
   ```text
   Invalid value: [min <= value <= max], try again:
   ```
   Replace `min` and `max` with the respective values.

#### Outcome:
The function should return a valid integer within the specified range after enforcing all validation rules.

## [Back to milestones](#milestones)

# Milestone 3: 
## Billable, Food, and Drink Modules

> **Note:**  
In this milestone, as before, you should simplify your code by implementing helper functions in the `Utils` module. This module should provide utilities for tasks such as dynamic memory allocation, foolproof data entry, and string manipulation. 
---

### `Billable` Class
The `Billable` class serves as an abstract base for items that can be added to a customer’s bill. It contains attributes and methods that define shared functionality among all billable items.

1. **Attributes:**
   - **`m_name`**: A dynamically allocated C-string to hold the name or description of the item.
   - **`m_price`**: A `double` representing the base price of the item.

2. **Protected Methods:**
   - **`void price(double value)`**: Sets the item’s price.
   - **`void name(const char* name)`**: Sets the item’s name, handling dynamic allocation.

3. **Public Methods and Overloads:**
   - **Constructors and Destructor**:
     - A default constructor initializes an empty `Billable` item.
     - Copy constructor and assignment operator to handle deep copies of dynamic members.
     - A virtual destructor ensures proper cleanup of derived objects.

   - **Virtual Methods**:
     - **`double price() const`**: Returns the item’s price, allowing derived classes to override if needed.

   - **Pure Virtual Methods** (to be implemented in derived classes):
     - **`ostream& print(ostream& ostr=cout)const`**: Displays item information in a formatted way.
     - **`bool order()`**: Takes customer order for details of the item (e.g., size, customizations).
     - **`bool ordered()const`**: Returns true if details have been set, indicating the item is ordered.
     - **`ifstream& read(ifstream& file)`**: Reads item details from an input file.

   - **Operator Overloads**:
      ```c++
      double operator+(double money, const Billable& B);
      double& operator+=(double& money, const Billable& B);
      ```
     - `+` and `+=` are overloaded to allow adding an item’s price to a total amount (of type `double`), enabling easy bill calculations.
     - **Conversion Operator (`operator const char*()const`)**: Provides access to the name for display or comparison.

---

### `Drink` Class
The `Drink` class inherits from `Billable` and represents a drink item. It adds functionality to manage the drink size and customizes price based on size.

1. **Attributes:**
   - **`m_size`**: A `char` indicating the size of the drink (e.g., `'S'` for small, `'M'` for medium, `'L'` for large, and `'X'` for extra large). If `m_size` is unset, it defaults to a safe empty state, and `"....."` will display for the size.

2. **Public Methods**:
   - **`print`**: Overrides `Billable`’s print to display or save the drink’s name, size, and price.
   
      The `print` method outputs the drink in the following format:
      - **name**: Up to 25 characters in 28 spaces, left-justified and padded with dots (`'.'`).
      - **size**: Displays as `"SML.."`, `"MID.."`, `"LRG.."`, `"XLR.."` for small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, respectively. If size is unset (i.e., `!ordered()`), it displays as `"....."`.
      - **price**: Right-justified in 7 spaces, padded with spaces and displayed with 2 decimal places.

   - **`order`**:  Overrides `Billable`’s order as follows:
      Displays a menu for drink size selection with 3 indentations:
      ```text
      Drink Size Selection
         1- Small
         2- Medium
         3- Larg
         4- Extra Large
         0- Back
      >
      ```
     Sets the order size to its acceptable values or leaves it unset if "Back" is selected.

     The method returns `true` if the size was selected (indicating it was ordered) or `false` if not.

   - **`ordered`**:  Overrides `Billable`’s ordered, returning `true` if a size has been selected.

   - **`read`**:  Overrides `Billable`’s read.
     Reads the drink’s details from a comma-separated input file in the following format:
     ```text
     name of drink,price
     ```
     Example:
     ```text
     Orange Juice,3.5<Newline>
     ```
     If the read is successful
      - the details are set to corresponding values
      - m_size is set to its default value
     
     Otherwise, nothing changes.

   - **`price`**: Adjusts the base price based on `m_size` as follows:
     - Returns `Billable` price if size is large or if item is not ordered.
     - For small, returns half of the price; for medium, returns 3/4 of the price; and for extra large, returns 1.5 times the original price.

3. Since this class does not manage resources outside of its scope, it does not require implementing the rule of three. The object is always created in a safe empty state.

---

### `Food` Class
The `Food` class, derived from `Billable`, represents a food item and includes functionality for customization and portion type.

1. **Attributes:**
   - **`m_ordered`**: A boolean flag indicating whether the item has been ordered.
   - **`m_child`**: A boolean representing if the food is a child portion, which affects pricing.
   - **`m_customize`**: A dynamically allocated C-string for storing customization notes (e.g., "No onions").

2. **Public Methods and Overloads**:
   - **Constructors and Destructor**: The copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor manage dynamic allocation for `m_customize`. The no-argument constructor leaves the object in a safe empty state.

   - **`print`**: Overrides `Billable`’s print to display or save the food item’s details, including portion type. Customizations are printed only if the `ostream` object is `cout`:
     - **name**: Up to 25 characters in 28 spaces, left-justified and padded with dots (`'.'`).
     - **portion type**: Displays `"Child"` or `"Adult"` if `ordered()` is `true` and `m_child` is set. Otherwise, it displays `"....."`.
     - **price**: Right-justified in 7 spaces, padded with spaces, and displayed with 2 decimal places.
     - **customizations**: If `m_customize` is not null and `ostream` is `cout`, it prints `" >> "` followed by the first 30 characters of `m_customize`. Otherwise, nothing is printed.

   - **`order`**:  Overrides `Billable`’s order as follows:
      Displays a menu for food portion selection with 3 indentations:
      ```text
      Food Size Selection
         1- Adult
         2- Child
         0- Back
      > 
      ```
      Sets the order portion to its acceptable values, setting `m_ordered` to `true`. If "Back" is selected, the portion remains unset, m_ordered is set to false and m_customize is deallocated.

      If a portion is ordered, the user is prompted for customization:
      ```text
      Special instructions
      > 
      ```
      If the user just presses enter, no customization is added, and `m_customize` is deallocated and set to nullptr. Otherwise, customization instructions are stored in `m_customize` (you may refer to the `Utils` functions for dynamic memory allocation here).

      The method returns `true` if a portion is ordered, or `false` if not.

   - **`ordered`**:  Overrides `Billable`’s ordered, returning the `m_ordered` flag.

   - **`read`**:  Overrides `Billable`’s read.
     Reads the food’s details from a comma-separated input file in the following format:
     ```text
     name of Food,price
     ```
     Example:
     ```text
     Pasta with Tomato sauce,3.5<Newline>
     ```
     If the read is successful
      - the details are set to corresponding values
      - m_child and m_order are set to thier default values
      - m_customize is deleted and set to nullptr
      
     Otherwise, the object remains unchanged.

   - **`price`**: Overrides `Billable`’s price. 
     Returns half the price if ordered and `m_child` is true, indicating a child portion; otherwise, it returns the original `Billable` price.

## [Back to milestones](#milestones)


# Milestone 4:  
## Ordering Module  

Continue developing the system by implementing the `Ordering` module. This module encapsulates and organizes all the tasks involved in taking orders. The methods of this class will be invoked when the options of the main menu are selected by the waiter, assisting with taking customer orders at the restaurant.

---

### Attributes  

#### Billable, Food, and Drink Counters  

The `Ordering` module includes attributes to track the number of food and drink items in the menu and the number of billable items added to a bill. These attributes ensure proper organization and management of the ordering process:  

- **Food Counter**: An integer (preferably unsigned) to keep track of the number of food items loaded from the food data file.  
- **Drink Counter**: An integer (preferably unsigned) to keep track of the number of drink items loaded from the drink data file.  
- **Billable Counter**: An integer (preferably unsigned) to track the number of `Billable` items added to the bill from the food and drink menu.

---

#### Bill Number  

- **Bill Serial Number**: An integer (preferably unsigned) representing the bill serial number, starting from 1. This number increments each time a new bill is generated. It is also used to create a unique file name for each completed bill saved to the file system.  

> **Note:**  
Use the following function, `makeBillFileName` and add it to the `Utils` module to generate unique file names. This function receives a bill number and creates a file name in the format `bill_[billNo].txt`.   
```cpp
 char* Utils::makeBillFileName(char* filename, size_t billNo)const {
    char billFileName[21] = "bill_";
    size_t temp = billNo;
    int cnt = 5;
    int length;
    // Calculate the number of digits
    do {
       cnt++;
       temp /= 10;
    } while (temp > 0);
    length = cnt;
    // Convert each digit to character from the end
    while (billNo > 0) {
       billFileName[--cnt] = (billNo % 10) + '0';
       billNo /= 10;
    }
    // Handle the case when billNo is 0
    if (billFileName[cnt - 1] == '\0') {
       billFileName[--cnt] = '0';
    }
    // Attach .txt to the end of the file name
    for (int i = 0; ".txt"[i]; i++) {
       billFileName[length++] = ".txt"[i];
    }
    billFileName[length] = '\0';
    strcpy(filename, billFileName);
    return filename;
 }

```
---

#### Food and Drink Dynamic Arrays  

- **Food Array**: A `Food` pointer used to store a dynamically allocated array of food items loaded from the food data file.  
- **Drink Array**: A `Drink` pointer used to store a dynamically allocated array of drink items loaded from the drinks data file.

---

#### Billable Array of Pointers  

- **Bill Items**: An array of `Billable` pointers, with a size defined by the `MaximumNumberOfBillItems` constant in `constants.h`. When a food or drink item is about to be ordered, a dynamic copy of the selected item is created and stored in the next available spot in this array. The item is then customized to match the customer’s order.

---

### Private Methods  

#### **Bill Title Print**  
This method prints a header for a bill.  

- **Parameters**:  
  - A reference to an `ostream` object.  

- **Description**:  
  The method prints the bill title in the following format, using the `Bill Number` attribute. For example, if the bill number is `35`, the output would look like:  

  ```text
  Bill # 035 =============================<NEWLINE>
  ```  

---

#### **Print Totals**  
This method prints the footer for a bill.  

- **Parameters**:  
  - A reference to an `ostream` object.  
  - A `double` value representing the total amount.  

- **Description**:  
  The method prints the total, applicable tax, and the grand total into the provided `ostream` object using the `Tax` constant value defined in `constants.h`. For example, if the total value is `16.88`, the output would be:  

  ```text
                       Total:        16.88
                       Tax:           2.19
                       Total+Tax:    19.07
  ========================================<NEWLINE>
  ```

---

#### **`size_t countRecords(const char* file) const`**  

This function calculates the number of records in a file by counting the newline characters.  

- **Parameters**:  
  - A constant character pointer (`const char*`) representing the file name.  

- **Return Value**:  
  - Returns the count of newline characters (`size_t`), representing the number of records in the file.  

- **Implementation**:  
  Use the following pseudocode to implement this function:  

  ```text
  set a newline counter to zero
  open an ifstream using the file argument value
  while the file is not in a failure state
     read one character
     if the file is not in failure state and character is a newline
        add one to the newline counter
  end while
  return the newline counter
  ```  

- **Purpose**:  
  This method is essential for determining the size of dynamically allocated arrays for food and drink items by counting the number of records in their respective files.


### Constructor and Destructor  

#### **Constructor**  

The `Ordering` class is constructed using two C-strings representing the drinks and foods data file names.  

**Steps for Implementation:**  

1. **Count Records:**  
   - Determine the number of records in the drinks and foods data files by using the `countRecords` method. Store these counts in two local variables.  

2. **Open Files for Reading:**  
   - Open the drinks and foods data files using `ifstream`.  

3. **Dynamic Array Allocation:**  
   - Create two dynamic arrays:  
     - A `Food` array, pointed to by the corresponding attribute of the `Ordering` class.  
     - A `Drink` array, pointed to by the corresponding attribute of the `Ordering` class.  

4. **Reading Data:**  
   - If both files are successfully opened:  
     - Loop through the drinks array, calling the `read` method on each element until one of the following occurs:  
       - The number of reads matches the number of records in the file.  
       - A read operation fails.  
     - Repeat the same process for the foods array.  

5. **Validation and Cleanup:**  
   - If the number of successfully read records does not match the number of records in either file:  
     - Revert the operation by **deleting** both arrays.  
     - Set the pointers for both arrays to `nullptr` (safe empty state).  
   - Otherwise:  
     - Set the corresponding attributes of the `Ordering` class to the number of records successfully read.  

---

#### **Destructor**  

The destructor ensures proper cleanup of dynamically allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.  

**Steps for Implementation:**  

1. **Delete Dynamic Arrays:**  
   - Delete the dynamic arrays for foods and drinks by using the `delete[]` operator.  

2. **Delete Billable Items:**  
   - Loop through the `Billable` array of pointers, deleting each element up to the number of items currently in the bill.  

---

### Queries  

> **Note:** Queries cannot change the state of the class.


#### **Boolean Conversion Operator Overload**  
This operator provides a safe empty state indicator.

- **Description:**  
  - This method does not modify the class.  
  - Returns `true` if both the drinks and foods dynamic arrays are not `nullptr`.  

---

#### **Number of Bill Items**  
Method name: 'noOfBillItems'

- **Description:**  
  - Create a method to return the number of items currently in the bill.  
  - This value is stored in the `Billable` counter attribute of the class.  

---

#### **Has Unsaved Bill**  
Method name: `hasUnsavedBill`

- **Description:**  
  - Create a method that returns a boolean value.  
  - This method should return `true` if the number of bill items (tracked by the `Billable` counter attribute) is greater than zero.  
---

## [Back to milestones](#milestones)

# Milestone 5: The Final Milestone  

In this milestone, you will use all the modules you have created so far to build a complete application for the "Dine-In Digital" system. This milestone brings together the logic for menu navigation, order processing, bill handling, and dynamic memory management.  

The goal is to create a program that mimics the behavior demonstrated in the `appDemo()` function provided earlier. Follow the instructions below to structure your program and meet the milestone's requirements.  

---

## Program Requirements  

Your program should use the `Menu` and `Ordering` modules to create a fully functioning application that supports the following tasks:  

---

### Initialization  

1. **Data Files**:  
   - Your program must load the food and drink data from two CSV files:  
     - `"drinks.csv"` for drinks.  
     - `"foods.csv"` for food items.  
   - Pass the file names to the `Ordering` class during initialization.  

2. **Validation**:  
   - If the `Ordering` object fails to load the data (i.e., it enters a safe empty state), display an error message:  
     ```text
     Failed to open data files or the data files are corrupted!
     ```  
   - Terminate the program if the data files are not loaded successfully.  

---

### Menus  

#### Main Menu  

- **Menu Title**: `"Seneca Restaurant"`  
- **Exit Option**: `"End Program"`  
- **Menu Options**:  
  1. **Order**  
  2. **Print Bill**  
  3. **Start a New Bill**  
  4. **List Foods**  
  5. **List Drinks**  

#### Sub-Menu for Ordering  

- **Menu Title**: `"Order Menu"`  
- **Exit Option**: `"Back to main menu"`  
- **Menu Options**:  
  1. **Food**  
  2. **Drink**  

#### Confirmation Menu  

- **Menu Title**: `"You have bills that are not saved. Are you sue you want to exit?"`  
- **Exit Option**: `"No"`  
- **Menu Option**:  
  1. **Yes**  

---

### Menu Functionality  

1. **Order Food**  
   - When the "Food" option is selected from the order sub-menu:  
     - Call the `orderFood` method of the `Ordering` object to handle food ordering.  

2. **Order Drink**  
   - When the "Drink" option is selected from the order sub-menu:  
     - Call the `orderDrink` method of the `Ordering` object to handle drink ordering.  

3. **Print Bill**  
   - When the "Print Bill" option is selected from the main menu:  
     - Call the `printBill` method of the `Ordering` object to print the current bill to the console.  

4. **Start a New Bill**  
   - When the "Start a New Bill" option is selected:  
     - Call the `resetBill` method of the `Ordering` object to save the current bill to a file and start a new one.  

5. **List Foods**  
   - When the "List Foods" option is selected:  
     - Call the `listFoods` method of the `Ordering` object to display all food items.  

6. **List Drinks**  
   - When the "List Drinks" option is selected:  
     - Call the `listDrinks` method of the `Ordering` object to display all drink items.  

---

### Program Exit  

1. **Unsaved Bills Warning**:  
   - If the user attempts to exit the program (selects "End Program") while there are unsaved items in the bill:  
     - Display a confirmation menu asking:  
       ```text
       You have bills that are not saved. Are you sue you want to exit?
       ```  
     - The menu should have the following options:  
       1. **Yes**  
       0. **No**  

   - If the user selects "No," return to the main menu.  
   - If the user selects "Yes," terminate the program.  

2. **Normal Exit**:  
   - If there are no unsaved bills, allow the program to terminate without additional prompts.  

---

### User Input Validation  

Your program should use foolproof input handling for all menu interactions. This ensures the program does not crash due to invalid user input. Follow these steps for validation:

#### Example Scenario  
##### Execution sample:
```text
Seneca Restaurant 
 1- Order
 2- Print Bill
 3- Start a New Bill
 4- List Foods
 5- List Drinks
 0- End Program
><ENTER> 
You must enter a value: abc<ENTER> 
Invalid integer: 1 abc<ENTER> 
Only an integer please: -1<ENTER> 
Invalid value: [0<= value <=5], try again: 6<ENTER> 
Invalid value: [0<= value <=5], try again: 0<ENTER>
```
##### Explanation
Given the following menu:  
```text
Seneca Restaurant
 1- Order
 2- Print Bill
 3- Start a New Bill
 4- List Foods
 5- List Drinks
 0- End Program
> 
```  

If the user inputs invalid data, the program should respond as follows and wait for re-entry:  
1. **Empty Input:**  
   ```text
   You must enter a value:
   ```  
2. **Non-Integer Input:**  
   ```text
   Invalid integer: 
   ```  
3. **Trailing Characters After Integer:**  
   ```text
   Only an integer please: 
   ```  
4. **Out of Range Input:**  
   ```text
